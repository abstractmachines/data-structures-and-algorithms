# Simple Array Sum : C++11 and Java 8

I decided to do this in both languages for fun.

C++: Compile with all warnings and run.

```
$ g++ -Wall simple-array-sum.cpp -std=c++11 -o sum

// makes .o object code file. Run that:

$ ./sum
```



Java: Compile into a class and run.

Note that Filename.java must be same as classname

```
$ javac SimpleArraySumSolution.java

// makes class SimpleArraySumSolution.class, now run

$ java SimpleArraySumSolution
```
